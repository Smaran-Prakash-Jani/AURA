# AURA – Emotional Memory Tags (Built using Base44)

AURA converts lived emotional moments into tiny 5-character codes that let you re-experience *why* something mattered.

## How it works

AURA infers emotional meaning from user input, categorizes it, and stores it in a compact Base44 token. Later, that token can be decoded to recover memory context.

## Dataset

This repository includes real data captured from AURA:
- see `/data/aura-memories-2025-11-26.json`

Sample memories:
- anxious late-night exam prep → `X9A!P`
- nostalgia from mom’s recipe → `P7N-Q`
- coffee date with Sarah → `M2K4Z`

## Status

Prototype created during the Base44 Ideathon.
